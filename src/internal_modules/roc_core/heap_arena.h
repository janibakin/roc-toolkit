//! Default heap arena guards.
//! Leak guard is disabled by default, because in C API leaks may be caused by user
//! (e.g. if context wasn't closed before program exit). We don't want to turn bugs
//! in user code into panics, only bugs in our own code should cause panics.

//! Heap arena implementation.
//!
//! Uses malloc() and free().
//!
//! The memory is always maximum aligned.
//!
//! Implements three safety measures:
//!  - to catch double-free and other logical bugs, inserts link to owning arena before
//!    user data, and panics if it differs when memory is returned to arena
//!  - to catch buffer overflow bugs, inserts "canary guards" before and after user
//!    data, and panics if they are overwritten when memory is returned to arena
//!  - to catch uninitialized-access and use-after-free bugs, "poisons" memory when it
//!    returned to user, and when it returned back to the arena
//!
//! Allocated chunks have the following format:
//! @code
//!  +-------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
//!  | ChunkHeader | ChunkCanary | user data | ChunkCanary |
//!  +-------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
//! @endcode
//!
//! ChunkHeader contains pointer to the owning arena, checked when returning memory to
//! arena. ChunkCanary contains magic bytes filled when returning memory to user, and
//! checked when returning memory to arena.
//!
//! Thread-safe.
