//! Base class for task-based pipelines.
//!
//! Frames, tasks, and threads
//! --------------------------
//!
//! The pipeline processes frames and tasks. This processing is serialized. At every
//! moment, the pipeline is either processing a frame, processing a task, or doing
//! nothing.
//!
//! The pipeline does not have its own thread. Both frame and task processing happens
//! when the user calls one of the pipeline methods, in the context of the caller thread.
//! Methods may be called from different threads, concurrently. This complicates the
//! implementation, but allows to have different thread layouts for different use cases.
//!
//! Precise task scheduling
//! -----------------------
//!
//! This class implements "precise task scheduling" feature, which tries to schedule task
//! processing intervals smartly, to prevent time collisions with frame processing and
//! keep frame processing timings unaffected.
//!
//! Precise task scheduling is enabled by default, but can be disabled via config. When
//! disabled, no special scheduling is performed and frame and task processing compete
//! each other for the exclusive access to the pipeline.
//!
//! The sections below describe various aspects of the implementation.
//!
//! Task processing time slices
//! ---------------------------
//!
//! Tasks are processed between frames on dedicated time slices, to ensure that the
//! task processing wont delay frame processing, which should be as close to real-time
//! as possible.
//!
//! If frame is too large, it's split into sub-frames, to allow task processing between
//! these sub-frames. This is needed to ensure that the task processing delay would not
//! be too large, at least while there are not too much tasks.
//!
//! If frames are too small, tasks are processing only after some of the frames instead
//! of after every frame. This is needed to reduce task processing overhead when using
//! tiny frames.
//!
//! There are two types of time slices dedicated for task processing:
//!  - in-frame task processing: short intervals between sub-frames
//!    (inside process_frame_and_tasks())
//!  - inter-frame longer intervals between frames
//!    (inside process_tasks())
//!
//! process_frame_and_tasks() calls are to be driven by the user-defined pipeline
//! clock. It should be called exactly when it's time to process more samples. Our
//! goal is to provide it exclusive access to the pipeline as fast as possible
//! immediately after it's called.
//!
//! process_tasks() should be called by user when there are pending tasks that should
//! be processed and when no concurrent process_frame_and_tasks() call is running.
//! Our goal is to notify the user if and when it should be called.
//!
//! Asynchronous task processing
//! ----------------------------
//!
//! Since pipeline does not have its own thread, it can't schedule process_tasks()
//! invocation by its own. Instead, it relies on the user-provided IPipelineTaskScheduler
//! object.
//!
//! When the pipeline wants to schedule asynchronous process_tasks() invocation, it
//! calls IPipelineTaskScheduler::schedule_task_processing(). It's up to the user when and
//! on which thread to invoke process_tasks(), but pipeline gives a hint with the ideal
//! invocation time.
//!
//! The pipeline may also cancel the scheduled task processing by invoking
//! IPipelineTaskScheduler::cancel_task_processing().
//!
//! In-place task processing
//! ------------------------
//!
//! If schedule() or schedule_and_wait() is called when the task queue is empty and the
//! current time point belongs to the task processing time slice, the new task is
//! processed in-place without waiting for the next process_frame_and_tasks() or
//! process_tasks() invocation. This allows to avoid extra delays and thread switches
//! when possible.
//!
//! Processing priority
//! -------------------
//!
//! When process_frame_and_tasks() is called, it increments pending_frame_ atomic
//! and blocks on pipeline_mutex_. The non-zero atomic indicates that a frame needs
//! to be processed as soon as possible and other methods should give it a way.
//!
//! When process_frame_and_tasks() is called, it also cancels any scheduled
//! asynchronous task processing before starting processing the frame and tasks.
//! Before exiting, process_frame_and_tasks() checks if there are still some pending
//! tasks and if necessary, schedules asynchronous execution again.
//!
//! When process_tasks() is processing asynchronous tasks, but detects that
//! process_frame_and_tasks() was invoked concurrently from another thread, it gives
//! it a way and exits. process_frame_and_tasks() will process the frame and some of
//! the remaining tasks, and if there are even more tasks remaining, it will invoke
//! schedule_task_processing() to allow process_tasks() to continue.
//!
//! When schedule() and process_tasks() want to invoke schedule_task_processing(), but
//! detect that process_frame_and_tasks() was invoked concurrently from another thread,
//! they give it a way and don't call schedule_task_processing(), assuming that
//! process_frame_and_tasks() will either process all tasks or call
//! schedule_task_processing() by itself.
//!
//! Locking rules
//! -------------
//!
//! pipeline_mutex_ protects the internal pipeline state. It should be acquired to
//! process a frame or a task.
//!
//! scheduler_mutex_ protects IPipelineTaskScheduler invocations. It should be acquired to
//! schedule or cancel asynchronous task processing.
//!
//! If pipeline_mutex_ is locked, it's guaranteed that the thread locking it will
//! check pending tasks after unlocking the mutex and will either process them or
//! scheduler asynchronous processing.
//!
//! If scheduler_mutex_ is locked, it's guaranteed that the thread locking it will
//! either schedule or cancel asynchronous task processing, depending on whether
//! there are pending tasks and frames.
//!
//! Lock-free operations
//! --------------------
//!
//! schedule() and process_tasks() methods are lock-free. Also, they're either completely
//! wait-free or "mostly" wait-free (i.e. on the fast path), depending on the hardware
//! architecture (see comments for core::MpscQueue).
//!
//! In practice it means that when running concurrently with other PipelineLoop method
//! invocations, they never block waiting for other threads, and usually even don't spin.
//!
//! This is archived by using a lock-free queue for tasks, atomics for 32-bit counters,
//! seqlocks for 64-bit counters (which are reduced to atomics on 64-bit CPUs), always
//! using try_lock() for mutexes and delaying the work if the mutex can't be acquired,
//! and using semaphores instead of condition variables for signaling (which don't
//! require blocking on mutex, at least on modern platforms; e.g. on glibc they're
//! implemented using an atomic and a futex).
//!
//! process_frame_and_tasks() is not lock-free because it has to acquire the pipeline
//! mutex and can't delay its work. However, the precise task scheduling feature does it
//! best to ensure that the pipeline mutex will be unlocked when process_frame_and_tasks()
//! is invoked, thus in most cases it wont block or wait too.
//!
//! This approach helps us with our global goal of making all inter-thread interactions
//! mostly wait-free, so that one thread is never or almost never blocked when another
//! thread is blocked, preempted, or busy.
//!
//! Benchmarks
//! ----------
//!
//! PipelineLoop is covered with two groups of benchmarks:
//!  - bench_pipeline_loop_peak_load.cpp measures frame and task processing delays with
//!    or without task load and with or without precise task scheduling feature;
//!  - bench_pipeline_loop_contention.cpp measures scheduling times under different
//!    contention levels.
//!
//! You can run them using "roc-bench-pipeline" command. For further details, see
//! comments in the source code of the benchmarks.
