//! TCP connection port.
//!
//! Public interfaces
//! -----------------
//!
//! There are two important interfaces related to TCP connection:
//!  - IConn
//!  - IConnHandler
//!
//! IConn is implemented by TcpConnectionPort. The interface allows to retrieve
//! connection parameters and perform non-blocking I/O.
//!
//! IConnHandler is implemented by users of netio module. This interface is notified
//! about connection state changes (e.g. connection is established) and availability
//! of I/O (e.g. connection becomes readable).
//!
//! Thread access
//! -------------
//!
//! Methods that are not part of IConn interface are called from within other netio
//! classes, e.g. TcpServerPort, on the network loop thread.
//!
//! Methods from the IConn interface are called by users of netio module from any
//! thread. They are thread-safe and lock-free.
//!
//! Connection type and lifecycle
//! -----------------------------
//!
//! Connection can be client-side (connect call) or server-side (accept call).
//!
//! Client-side connection is created using AddTcpClientPort task of the network
//! loop, and is closed using RemovePort task. Before removing the port, the user
//! must call async_terminate() and wait until termination is completed.
//!
//! Server-side connection is created by TcpServerPort when it receives a new
//! incoming connection. To remove it, the user should call async_terminate().
//! When termination is completed, TcpServerPort automatically closes and
//! destroys connection.
//!
//! Connection workflow
//! -------------------
//!
//! The following rules must be followed:
//!
//!  - if you called open(), even if it failed, you're responsible for calling
//!    async_close() and waiting for its completion before destroying connection
//!  - after calling open(), you should call either accept() or connect() before
//!    using connection
//!  - if you called connect() or accept(), even if it failed, you're responsible
//!    for calling async_terminate() and waiting for its completion before calling
//!    async_close()
//!  - after connection is established and before it's terminated you can
//!    perform I/O
//!  - even if connection can't be established, async_terminate() still should be
//!    called before closing and destryoing connection
//!
//! Connection FSM
//! --------------
//!
//! TcpConnectionPort maintains an FSM and sees each operation or event handler as a
//! transition between states. Each operation is allowed only in certain states and
//! will panic when not used properly.
//!
//! State switch mostly happens on the network thread, however some limited set of
//! transitions is allowed from other threads. For this reason, state switching is
//! done using atomic operations.
